# RTModel
RTModel is a package for modeling and interpretation of microlensing events. It uses photometric time series collected from ground and/or space telescopes to propose one or more possible models among the following:
- Single-lens-single-source microlensing (i.e. Paczynski)
- Single-lens-binary-source microlensing (with or without xallarap)
- Binary-lens-single-source microlensing (including planetary microlensing, parallax and orbital motion)

# Model categories

In the current version, `RTModel` offers 7 different model categories. Each of them has a speficic label with two characters. This table summarizes the main information

| Label | Model | Number of parameters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PS | Single-lens-single-source | 4 |
| PX | Single-lens-single-source with parallax | 6 |
| BS | Single-lens-binary-source | 7 |
| BO | Single-lens-binary-source with xallarap | 10 |
| LS | Binary-lens-single-source | 7 |
| LX | Binary-lens-single-source with parallax | 9 |
| LO | Binary-lens-single-source with orbital motion | 12 |

The following sections provide details about parameters and conventions.

## Single-lens-single-source

This is the basic microlensing model with a single-lens and a single-source. Note that `RTModel` only considers finite-source models. In most cases, there will be no constraints on the source radius anyway.

The parameters of this model are

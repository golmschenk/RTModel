## Satellite observations

Observations from satellites, if available, are identified through the filename ending with a number, e.g. `Spitzer1.dat`. Each satellite is identified by a different number that is used to select the correct ephemerides table.

All other files ending by anything that is not a number is considered as taken from a ground telescope.
